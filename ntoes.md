## Ease of use

Something that would make it harder on you guys but make the technology side a
lot easier would be to create fully static images for each potential variation.
Then we don't have to worry about overlaying different sized images.

## How important is it for each custom calendar to have its own SKU?

#### It's not.

If it's not, then let's not even worry about it. Everytime someone orders a
custom calendar, I can populate the description of the product with all of the
details about the individual components.

#### It's pretty important

Okay, well what if the SKU numbers were dynamically generated? This would save
you guys a lot of time in setting everything up. For example, let's say that
each calendar only has two attributes: frame and background.

For the frame, there are three options: barnwood, redwood, and yellowwood.
For the background, there are two options: black and white.

For each custom calendar ordered, we can have a base SKU to indicate that it
is a custom calendar. For example, let's say that the base SKU is 1234.

Once the customer chooses everything that they want and they submit their custom
creation, then the SKU is dynamically created.

We can assign each attribute a number: frame can be 1, and background can be 2.

Then, we can assign each option with those attributes a number:

1- barnwood
2- redwood
3- yellowwood

1-black
2-white

A customer who chooses barnwood as the frame and white as the background would
be generating a product whose SKU looks like this:

1234-1122

This way, you guys don't have to worry about all of the individual products, nor
do you have to sacrifice SKU numbers. Instead, you can worry about the
individual attributes of each configuration (which will have to change per
orientation/size), and that's it.
